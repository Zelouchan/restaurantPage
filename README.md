Restaurant Page for the Odin Project

This project was a lot of fun to do, using webpack and different modules really helped with the concept of modular code and the fact that it was not difficult was a bonus. Writing so much repetitive code by hand was a bit time consuming, but i enjoyed the oppertunity to do some experimenting with styling. 
The biggest thing i learned is how to use loops for dom manipulation.
The coolest thing i learned was how to make flip card as used in the menu
What i will certainly use again? adding an active class to the current tab for styling purposes.
